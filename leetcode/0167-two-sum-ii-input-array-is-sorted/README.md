# 167. Two-Sum-II-Input-Array-Is-Sorted

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem:** [Two-Sum-II-Input-Array-Is-Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted)

---

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index 1 ]` and `numbers[index 2 ]` where `1 <= index 1 < index 2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers  `index 1` and `index 2` , **each incremented by one,** as an integer array `[index 1 , index 2 ]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

```
Input:  numbers = [ 2 , 7 ,11,15], target = 9
Output:  [1,2]
Explanation:  The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index 1  = 1, index 2  = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

Example 2:

```
Input:  numbers = [ 2 ,3, 4 ], target = 6
Output:  [1,3]
Explanation:  The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index 1  = 1, index 2  = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

Example 3:

```
Input:  numbers = [ -1 , 0 ], target = -1
Output:  [1,2]
Explanation:  The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index 1  = 1, index 2  = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10⁴`

- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`

- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.
